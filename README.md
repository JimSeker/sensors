<b>pitchrollX</b> demo the sensors in the device, like accelerometer, meagnetic_field (<b>pitchroll3</b>), orientation (<b>pitchroll</b>)

<b>8ball</b> is a demo using the magic 8 ball example.  It use the linear acceleration to determine if the "ball" is being shaken.

<b>gpsDemo</b> is an example of how to use the location/gps on the phone.

<b>FingerprintDialog</b> is googles example.  See https://github.com/googlesamples/android-FingerprintDialog/

<b>FingerPrintDemo</b> is a simple version to verify a "purchase" using the finger printer scanner.  It's based on android's FingerprintDialog, but far simplier.  It needs to be updated to use API 24/25 as well, but currently uses just the 23 methods.
