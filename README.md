Android Hardware Sensor and input Examples
===========
<b>eclipse/</b> has the examples in that eclipse can load. These are no longer updated.  Otherwise everything are Android Studio projects

<b>Input</b> and <b>input2</b> demo the keyboard, touch, gesture listeners

<b>pitchrollX</b> demo the sensors in the device, like accelerometer, meagnetic_field (<b>pitchroll3</b>), orientation (<b>pitchroll</b>)

<b>8ball</b> is a demo using the magic 8 ball example.  It use the linear acceleration to determine if the "ball" is being shaken.

<b>gpsDemo</b> is an example of how to use the location/gps on the phone.

<b>FingerprintDialog</b> is googles example.  See https://github.com/googlesamples/android-FingerprintDialog/

<b>FingerPrintDemo</b> is a simple version to verify a "purchase" using the finger printer scanner.  It's based on android's FingerprintDialog, but far simpler.  It needs to be updated to use API 24/25 as well, but currently uses just the 23 methods.

<b>nfc3</b> is an example of to set a nfc tag.

<b>nfcDemo</b> This shows an example of how to use beam.  You will need to two devices with nfc.  This app will beam a message to the other devices app.

<b>nfcDemo3</b> well send a file via nfc beam.  It only needs to be installed on one device.  fair warning, beaming is pretty slow, so don't try this with large files unless you can set the devices correctly on top of each other.

<b>StickyNotes</b> This example code is more complex, but can read and write nfc tags.

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
