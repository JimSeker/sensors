Android Hardware Sensor and input NFC Examples
===========

<b>NFCreadDemo</b> (java) Shows how to read NFC devices/tags and displays the information to the screen.

<b>NFCwriteDemo</b> (java) Shows how to write to  NFC devices/tags.  Use the readDemo on another phone to read the tag to see if worked.

<b>NFCReadWriteDemo</b> (java) combines the other examples, so you can read and write to tags in the same app.  it's a little more complex 
since you can not read and write at the same time.  

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course and Cosc 4735 Advanced Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
