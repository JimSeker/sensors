<b>NFCreadDemo</b> (java) Shows how to read NFC devices/tags and displays the information to the screen. works in api 35   This is older code the use the system and intenet to get the tags.

<b>NFCreadWriteDemo</b> (java) uses the new enableReader method, instead of intents.  So you can control the app better and sounds as well.  It can read most tags (hopefully) and can write to tags as well.
